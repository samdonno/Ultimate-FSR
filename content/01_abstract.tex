\section*{Abstract}

Modern electronics allowed us to integrate computational capabilities into everyday objects. In a world with an immense growth in sensor demand and production they still have not yet widely found their way into commonly used utilization for musical instruments. This creates space for further investigation in useful devices. Furthermore, sensor data accuracy plays an important role. Precise data are crucial for reliability.

This thesis investigates force sensing resistors (FSR) with application for accurate finger position and force exertion measurement. Used for musical instruments they can be used for educational purposes in a sense of detecting finger and hand posture and reveal poor force utilization, that could lead to exhaustion and sluggish note interchanges. Another useful application for the FSR would be a digital music sheet generator, by converting position measurement into midi files. A proper working real time conversion would then create a whole new horizon for augmented instruments.

The thesis presents a FSR system setup for position and area detection with an average error of less than 1.5mm. Based on position an offline algorithm to detect frequency of a played note on a fret instrument is presented.
